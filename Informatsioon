1.Page * Hayao Miyazaki
     
     Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese film director, producer, screenwriter, animator, author, and manga artist. A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, he has attained international acclaim 
     as a masterful storyteller and creator of animated feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.
     
     Hayao Miyazaki was born in Bunkyō ward of Tokyo on January 5, 1941. Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age and started his career in 1963 as an 
     animator at the Toei Douga studio, and was subsequently involved in many early classics of Japanese animation. From the beginning, he commanded attention with his 
     incredible drawing ability and the seemingly endless stream of movie ideas he proposed. In 1985 Miyazaki along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, a film and 
     animation studio wich would later on become world-renowned for their animated films. Studio Ghibli is responsible for six out of the fifteen highest grossing anime films 
     in Japan, with Spirited Away standing as number one.
     
     Miyazaki has been described as combining elements of Walt Disney, Steven Spielberg and Orson Welles.
