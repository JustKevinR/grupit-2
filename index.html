                Studio Ghibli, Inc., known simply as Ghibli, is a Japanese animation film studio headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo. The studio is best known for its animated feature films, 
   and has also produced several short subjects, television commercials, and one television film. The studio's mascot and most recognizable symbol is a character named Totoro,
   who is a giant cat-like spirit from the 1988 anime film My Neighbor Totoro. Among Studio Ghibli's highest-grossing films are Spirited Away (2001), Howl's Moving Castle (2004) 
   and Ponyo (2008). The studio was founded on June 15, 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after the successful performance of 
   Topcraft's Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (1984).  It has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several video games.
   Five of the studio's films are among the ten highest-grossing anime feature films made in Japan, with Spirited Away being number one, grossing over US$380 million at the 
   worldwide box office.
   
   The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli (also used in English), based on the Libyan Arabic name for hot desert wind, the idea being the studio
   would "blow a new wind through the anime industry".
   
   On August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production, following the retirement of Miyazaki. In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of 
   retirement again to direct a new feature film entitled How Do You Live?.
